# Deep Learning from the Ground Up – Custom Local ANN Toolkit

A self-contained, offline-first toolkit for building, training, and inspecting **custom artificial neural networks** from scratch.  
Designed for **deep understanding, rapid experimentation, and total control**, this toolkit combines a hand-crafted backpropagation engine, a dynamic network builder, hybrid training modes, and rich visualizations – all **without relying on internet access or external APIs**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **From Scratch Backpropagation Engine**  
  Implemented entirely with **NumPy**, ensuring transparency and full customization.
  
- **Dynamic Architecture Builder**  
  Create custom network designs on the fly – any number of layers, neurons, or activation functions.

- **Hybrid Training Modes**  
  Mix-and-match training strategies to suit your data, from batch gradient descent to stochastic and adaptive approaches.

- **Fully Offline Operation**  
  No cloud dependencies – ideal for secure environments or learning from the ground up.

- **Rich Visualizations**  
  Use **Matplotlib**-powered tools to inspect training curves, neuron activations, and weight distributions for debugging and insights.

- **Educational & Practical**  
  Suitable for learning neural networks at the algorithmic level, while still capable of producing deployable models.

🛠 Usage Guide
Build a Custom Network
python
Copy
Edit
from builder.network_builder import NetworkBuilder
from training.trainer import Trainer
from visualization.visualizer import Visualizer

# Step 1: Build
builder = NetworkBuilder(input_size=2)
builder.add_layer(neurons=4, activation='relu')
builder.add_layer(neurons=1, activation='sigmoid')
network = builder.build()

# Step 2: Train
trainer = Trainer(network)
trainer.train(X, y, epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.1, mode='batch')

# Step 3: Visualize
Visualizer.plot_training_history(trainer.history)
📊 Visualization Tools
